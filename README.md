## About
- The program was executed on Windows OS.
- The chosen language was Python.
- The code editor used was Visual Studio Code.

## Run The Program

Follow these instructions to run the program:

1. Clone the project on your machine or download the ZIP file.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ssramirezr/project-teamls.git
    ```
2. Go to the project directory (or wherever you stored it).

4. Run the following in your command prompt:

    ```bash
    
    python main.py
    
    ```
    
4. Enter the number of grammars to process, for example:

    ```bash
       1
    ```
    
4. Enter the number of rules, for example:

    ```bash
      3
    ```
    
4. Enter production rules, for example:

    ```bash
    C SB
    ```
    
5. Check results.
     ```bash
